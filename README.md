### how to run the scripts
we have divided our scripts into 4 files
- DDL: the script to create tables, constraints
- UserCreatipon_Grants: the script to create 2 roles (dorm_user, dorm_management) and give proper grant to each role
- view: the script to create views for the database that provide quick access 
- DML: the script to insert the sample data (7 rows) for each table, it will skip the rows that have duplicate PK  
To run the project, run the scripts from 01 to 04 one by one.

Also, we provide a script that combine all scripts from these 4 files for TAs whoever that want to test our project 3
(just the simply combination of all file, run it to excute all script to create table, user, grant, view and insert data )

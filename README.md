### how to run the scripts
we have divided our scripts into 4 files
- DDL: the script to create tables, constraints
- UserCreatipon_Grants: the script to create 2 roles (dorm_user, dorm_management) and give proper grant to each role
- view: the script to create views for the database that provide quick access 
- DML: the script to insert the sample data (7 rows) for each table, it will skip the rows that have duplicate PK

  
**To run the project, run the scripts from 01 to 04 one by one (OR simply run the combine_of_all.sql).**

The combine_of_all.sql is just the simply combination of all file, it include scripts from all other 4 file)
